Developing Tools that Solve Linear Algebra Questions and Matrix Theory Problems -- Used in Data Science Applications

## About

This repository contains tools and scripts developed using Python to solve various linear algebra problems. The goal of this project is to provide easy-to-use solutions for common linear algebra questions encountered in academic and professional settings. Used in applciational data science such as SVDs, PCA, Linear Regression, Least Squares, etc.

## Features

- Efficient algorithms for solving linear equations
- Functions for matrix operations (addition, multiplication, inversion, etc.)
- Tools for eigenvalue and eigenvector computation
- Support for complex matrix operations
