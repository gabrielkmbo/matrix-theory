Matrix Theory
Developing Tools that Solve Linear Algebra Questions and Matrix Theory Problems -- Used in Data Science Applications

About
This repository contains tools and scripts developed using Python to solve various linear algebra problems. The goal of this project is to provide easy-to-use solutions for common linear algebra questions encountered in academic and professional settings. Used in applciational data science such as SVDs, PCA, Linear Regression, Least Squares, etc.

Features
Efficient algorithms for solving linear equations
Functions for matrix operations (addition, multiplication, inversion, etc.)
Tools for eigenvalue and eigenvector computation
Support for complex matrix operations
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt if available)
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/gabrielkmbo/matrix-theory.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd matrix-theory
Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Detailed usage instructions for each tool can be found in the corresponding script files. Here is a basic example of how to use one of the tools:

Python
from matrix_tools import solve_linear_equation

# Example usage
A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
B = [5, 6]
solution = solve_linear_equation(A, B)
print(solution)
